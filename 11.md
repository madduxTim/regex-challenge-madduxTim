Provide a regex (as if for a password checker), that enforces a password to have at least one symbol and one number.

#Regex 
- .+(?=.+[!@#$%;()\_\+\-\=\`\~\{\}\|\\\[\]]).+(?=.+[0-9]).{12,40}

#Text string 
 - (has to include at least 12 characters with at least one each: number, character, letter)
 - heressomethingthatislongenoughbutnochars (does not work)
 - p@55W3rd!!!!!!
